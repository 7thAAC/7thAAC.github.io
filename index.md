We welcome you to the **7th Australian Algebra Conference**, to be held at **Monash University** (Clayton Campus in Melbourne), from **November 22-24, 2023**.

The main aim of the annual Australian Algebra Conference is to foster communication between algebraists in Australia. We interpret algebra quite broadly, including areas such as topological algebra, algebraic logic, graph theory and coding theory. The conference is run by the [Australian Algebra Group](https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/austalg/about-us), which is a special interest group of the [Australian Mathematical Society](https://austms.org.au/).

The conference has a proud tradition of encouraging talks by students: typically about one third of the talks are presented by students. The conference aims to provide graduate students in algebra with the opportunity to give their first public presentation in a relaxed and supportive environment. Each conference, the most outstanding student talk is awarded the [Gordon Preston Prize](https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/austalg/gordon-preston-prize).

## Gordon Preston Prize

The [Gordon Preston Prize](https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/austalg/gordon-preston-prize) is awarded for the best presentation at the AAC given by a current student based at an Australian or overseas university. The presentations will be judged by a panel appointed by the executive committee. The winner of the prize will receive $300. [The Rules](https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/austalg/rules-for-the-gordon-preston-prize) for the Gordon Preston Prize are available on the website of the Australian Algebra Group. 

## Local Information
The conference will be held at the Clayton campus of Monash University in Melbourne.

All talks will be held in Lecture Theatre South 1 (43 Rainforest Walk), close to the bus loop: please see the Clayton Campus Map for details (a static version of the map is available here).

The Clayton campus is located about 25km south-east of the Melbourne CBD.

Here are some suggestions for accommodation close to Monash Clayton campus:

Clayton Serviced Apartments
Quest Notting Hill Serviced Apartments

ParkRoyal Monash Hotel 

If choosing to stay in the city instead, participants can reach the campus fairly easily by taking the Pakenham/Cranbourne train to Huntingdale, and then taking the 601 shuttle bus. This journey takes around 30-45min and both legs run regularly.
