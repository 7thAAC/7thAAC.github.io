We welcome you to the **7th Australian Algebra Conference**, to be held at **Monash University** (Clayton Campus in Melbourne), from **November 22-24, 2023**.

The main aim of the annual Australian Algebra Conference is to foster communication between algebraists in Australia. We interpret algebra quite broadly, including areas such as topological algebra, algebraic logic, graph theory and coding theory. The conference is run by the [Australian Algebra Group](https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/austalg/about-us), which is a special interest group of the [Australian Mathematical Society](https://austms.org.au/).

The conference has a proud tradition of encouraging talks by students: typically about one third of the talks are presented by students. The conference aims to provide graduate students in algebra with the opportunity to give their first public presentation in a relaxed and supportive environment. Each conference, the most outstanding student talk is awarded the [Gordon Preston Prize](https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/austalg/gordon-preston-prize).
